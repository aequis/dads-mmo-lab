# ⚙️ Dad's MMO Lab — Steam Deck Offline MMO Server Project

> *"The games we grew up with deserve to live forever. This project makes that possible on a single handheld device."*

## 🎯 What Is This?

This is a collection of **step-by-step guides, Docker scripts, and automated installers** for running classic MMO private servers **completely offline** on a Steam Deck (or any Linux machine).

No subscription. No internet required. No servers getting shut down. Just you and the games you love — forever.

Every guide here is built around:
- ✅ **Open source emulators only** — no copyrighted assets, no game files distributed
- ✅ **Docker-based** — clean, repeatable, easy to remove
- ✅ **Steam Deck tested** — every setup verified on SteamOS
- ✅ **Dad-friendly** — written for people who love games, not just developers
- ✅ **One command install** — automated installers handle everything

## 🌍 The Story

I'm a dad who grew up on MMOs. Like a lot of you, I watched the servers for games I loved get shut down one by one. Nostalrius. Felmyst. Games that meant something — gone.

Then I got a Steam Deck.

And I started wondering: *what if I could bring them back? Offline. On a handheld. Forever.*

Turns out — for a lot of classic MMOs — you can. The emulator community has done incredible work over the years. This project is about packaging that work into something any dad (or mom, or kid) can actually use.

**This is not piracy.** We use open source server emulators. You supply your own legally obtained game clients. We just help you run them.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Pick your game and run the installer. Each one handles everything automatically.

**WoW Vanilla 1.12:**
```bash
chmod +x install-wow-vanilla.sh && ./install-wow-vanilla.sh
```

**WoW The Burning Crusade:**
```bash
chmod +x install-wow-tbc.sh && ./install-wow-tbc.sh
```

**WoW Wrath of the Lich King:**
```bash
chmod +x install-wow-wotlk.sh && ./install-wow-wotlk.sh
```

**WoW Wrath of the Lich King — Unbound Edition:**
```bash
chmod +x install-wow-unbound.sh && ./install-wow-unbound.sh
```

**RuneScape 2009:**
```bash
chmod +x install-runescape.sh && ./install-runescape.sh
```

**RuneScape 2009 HD upgrade** *(run after the base installer):*
```bash
chmod +x upgrade-runescape-hd.sh && ./upgrade-runescape-hd.sh
```

**MapleStory v83 Pre-Big Bang:**
```bash
chmod +x install-maplestory.sh && ./install-maplestory.sh
```

**Mu Online:**
```bash
chmod +x install-muonline.sh && ./install-muonline.sh
```

Every WoW installer:
- ✅ Detects SteamOS and fixes the pacman keyring
- ✅ Installs Docker if needed
- ✅ Downloads and compiles the server
- ✅ Creates a default **admin / admin** account with GM Level 3
- ✅ Populates the world with bots
- ✅ Builds a Gaming Mode launcher

**New to Linux?** Read the HOWTO guide for your game first — every step explained in plain English, zero assumed knowledge.

## 🤖 Bot Options (WoW)

All WoW installers ship with **Playerbots** pre-configured — bots that roam the world, fill dungeons and raids, and keep the economy alive so the game feels like a real server, not an empty shell.

| | Vanilla | TBC | WotLK | WotLK Unbound |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bot engine** | CMaNGOS Playerbots | CMaNGOS Playerbots | AzerothCore Playerbots | AzerothCore Playerbots |
| **Bot count** | 600–800 active | 600–800 active | 600–800 active | 600–800 active |
| **Level range** | Endgame 50–60 | Outlands 57–70 | Full 1–80 (syncs to player) | Full 1–80 (syncs to player) |
| **Auction House** | Stocked | Stocked | Stocked | Stocked |
| **Install time** | ~30 min | ~30 min | ~30 min | ~30 min |

## ⚔️ WoW Unbound — Multi-Class System

WoW Unbound is a custom dual/triple class mod built on AzerothCore. Play WotLK as a classless hybrid — combine any classes into a character that's uniquely yours.

| Milestone | Unlock | Cost |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Level 5 | Dual Class | Free |
| Level 25 | Triple Class | 3g |
| Higher levels | Further unlocks | See guide |

- Full weapon, armor, and dual-wield access across all class combinations
- Hundreds of Playerbots fill the world
- Runs completely offline — your server, your rules, forever
- Open source under AGPL-3.0, consistent with AzerothCore

[📖 Full Guide](./guides/unbound-wrath/)

## 🎮 Gaming Mode Setup

Play entirely from Steam Gaming Mode — no Desktop Mode needed after setup:

1. Each installer creates a **Gaming Mode launcher** in your home folder
2. Add it to Steam as a Non-Steam game via Konsole:
   - **Target:** `/usr/bin/konsole`
   - **Launch Options:** `--hold -e bash ~/[game]-launcher.sh`
   - **Proton:** OFF (WoW uses Proton for the game client, not the server)
3. Launch from your Steam library
4. Wait for **"[GAME] IS READY!"**
5. Launch the game client from your library
6. Close the client → **server auto-shuts down**

Full setup instructions in each game's HOWTO guide.

---

## 🔧 After a SteamOS Update

If Docker stops working after a Steam Deck update:

```bash
chmod +x guides/Steam-Update-Fix/fix-after-update.sh
./guides/Steam-Update-Fix/fix-after-update.sh
```

Rebuilds the pacman keyring and reinstalls Docker automatically.

## 🛠️ How It Works

```
Steam Deck Gaming Mode
        │
        ▼
   Docker Container      ← Runs silently in background
   (Server Emulator)
        │
        ▼
  MySQL / MariaDB
   (Game Database)
        │
        ▼
Game Client via Proton
   → connects to localhost
   → completely offline
```

*(RuneScape runs without Docker — pure Java on Linux. No Proton needed.)*
